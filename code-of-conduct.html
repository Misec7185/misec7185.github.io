                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <p>
                    A primary goal of the Michigan Information Security community (#misec) is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all. And by all, we mean, including but not limited to, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).
                    <br><br>
                    This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. This code of conduct covers #misec meet-ups, #misec social platforms, and the conferences hosted by #misec: Converge and BSides Detroit.
                    <br><br>
                    We invite all those who participate in #misec to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.
                </p>

            <h2>Community Citizenship</h2>
                <p>
                    A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase community citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.
                    <br><br>
                    Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.
                    <br>
                    If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to <a href="mailto:info@misec.us">know</a>.
                </p>

                <h2>Expected Behavior</h2>
                <p>
                    The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

                    Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
                    Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
                    Attempt collaboration before conflict.
                    Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
                    Seek to learn from, rather than minimize or deny, the experiences of others.
                    Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow #misec participants. Alert #misec community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
                    Remember that #misec community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.
                </p>

                <h2>Unacceptable Behavior</h2>
                <p>
                    We do not tolerate harassment of members in any form. Members violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the #misec community at the discretion of the #misec leadership. The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.</li>
                        <li>Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.</li>
                        <li>Posting or displaying sexually explicit material.</li>
                        <li>Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”).</li>
                        <li>Personal insults; including but not limited to, insults related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.</li>
                        <li>Spreading rumors or information designed to malign or damage another member’s personal or professional reputation.</li>
                        <li>Inappropriate photography or recording.</li>
                        <li>Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.</li>
                        <li>Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes sexualized comments or jokes, and unwelcomed sexual advances.</li>
                        <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).</li>
                        <li>Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.</li>
                        <li>Promoting or engaging in illegal activities.</li>
                        <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h2>Weapons Policy</h2>
                <p>
                    #misec community members are expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter. Weapons include but are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks), and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in illegal possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon.
                </p>

                <h2>Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h2>
                <p>
                    Unacceptable behavior from any #misec community member, including speakers, sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

                    Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If you do not wish to comply with a request to modify your behavior, you may leave the event and file a grievance with #misec leadership.

                    If a #misec community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the #misec leadership may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning and, in the case of social events, workshops, or conferences, without refund.
                </p>

                <h2>Reporting Guidelines</h2>
                <p>
                    If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please <a href="mailto:info@misec.us">notify #misec leadership</a> as soon as possible. When reporting on unacceptable behavior, please add as much detail to the observed behavior by including a detailed description of the event, copies of communication, and any other pieces of evidence that can be provided. #misec leadership will keep a record of every reported case of unacceptable behavior.

                    Additionally, #misec leadership is available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe, including but not limited to, providing escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.
                </p>

                <h2>Addressing Grievances</h2>
                <p>
                    If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should <a href="mailto:info@misec.us">notify #misec leadership</a> with a concise description of your grievance.

                    It is the expectation of the #misec community that all members will immediately cease problematic behavior upon any reasonable request to do so. If you feel that this request is unreasonable, you may choose to leave the event and pursue the Grievance process outlined above. Continuing to engage in problematic behavior after a request to stop will result in a dismissal of your grievance.

                    #misec leadership will investigate every reported unacceptable behavior and has the right the right to take immediate action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning and, in the case of social events, workshops, or conferences, without refund. In the case of minor offenses, #misec leadership has adopted a three-strike policy:

                    <ol>
                        <li>Issue a warning to those involved in the unacceptable behavior.</li>
                        <li>Issue a final warning and a reminder that continued unacceptable behavior will result in a permanent ban from all #misec community events and activities.</li>
                        <li>A permanent ban from all #misec community events and activities.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <h2>Scope</h2>
                <p>
                    We expect all #misec members (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community events–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to the #misec community.

                    This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of #misec community when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of #misec community members. #misec leadership reserves the right to disinvite or ban individuals from the community, if they engage in harassing or discriminatory behavior at other community events. This includes any of the unacceptable behavior listed in section 4 of this CoC.
                </p>
